Development Notes:

TODO:

- Save torrent pages outside of imdb folders to avoid common results. DONE. Now testing.
- FIX: Warning:  Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /var/www/html/1337x-API/src/SaveTorrents1337x.class.php on line 121
- If imdb not found in torrent page do a strict match for title+year.
- Test tvshows after refactoring. Most of them are missing imdb codes. Find another way to identify them
- Some images are not screenshots in pages. Try to eliminate them. Difficult to solve.
- Check if torrent page has been downloaded. Keep a record in database. ( for multiple servers use )

STEPS to search and collect torrents:

	1. Get a list with titles with ImdbList() class to start searching. You need a database with Movies and Tv Shows information with their imdb codes
	2. Pass the titles to Search1337x() factory class to search for results, save their html pages and a record for search in databse.

         -HTML result pages are saved inside HTML_SEARCH_FILES_PATH (config file) imdb folders.
         -Search results records are saved in `search_summary` table. ( imdb, number of pages, last searched, active torrents (seeds), etc. )
         -Search results torrents are saved in `search_results` table. ( imdb, 1337x_id unique combination, link etc .)
         -Uses the following classes: 
           SearchResults1337x()
           ParseSearch1337x()
           SaveSearchResults()
	
	3. Use SaveTorrents1337x() factory class to download torrents (collected from `search_results` table), create a local JSON with their info, and save torrent info inside `1337xtorrents` table


[!] Test Movies
	
	###########################################################################################################
	Movienames that return too much irrelevant results: 
		2 + 2, 4, 9, Max, Spy, #Horror(2015), Ma ma (2015), Home (2015), Room (2015), Fury(2014),
		Frozen (2013), The Walk (2015), Black (2015)
		
	mysql clear tables: delete from 1337xtorrents; delete from search_results; delete from search_summary;
	
	Examples test to check conflicts and doubles: 

		Mad Max: Fury Road tt1392190 2015
		Max tt3369806 2015
		
		Love (2015)
		A Tale of Love and Darkness (2015)

[!] Test TV Shows
	-Tvshow Daredevil has Marvel in front of it. Take that into consideration when doing a match of imdb

	
[!] 2000 saved movies search results =~ 500mb

[!] You must add a delay between each request, otherwise ip is going to be banned. If you are banned you have to get a new ip/server. 
	Banned IP seems irreversable.
    Currently delay is set to 5 seconds between each search and 3 seconds to browse through results pages ( page 1,2,3 .. last )
    
[!] You must encode title name (movie,tvshow), before search other wise you get a bad request.Use urlencode function.

[!] Issues & Problems:

	Folders to save html files should be named by imdb codes to ensure data integrity.

[!] Data is saved in downloaded files and in database. After testing is complete you can delete folders.
