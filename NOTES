Development Notes:

TODO:

1.Save torrent pages outside of imdb folders to avoid common results.
2.Some images are not screenshots in pages. Try to eliminate them. Difficult to solve.



[!] NOTE for Movies:
	
	###########################################################################################################
	Movienames that return too much irrelevant results: 
		2 + 2, 4, 9, Max, Spy, #Horror(2015), Ma ma (2015), Home (2015), Room (2015), Fury(2014),
		Frozen (2013), The Walk (2015), Black (2015)
		
	mysql clear tables: delete from 1337xtorrents; delete from search_results; delete from search_summary;
	
	Examples test to check conflicts and doubles: 

		Mad Max: Fury Road tt1392190 2015
		Max tt3369806 2015
		
		Love (2015)
		A Tale of Love and Darkness (2015)

Files on disk:
2000 saved movies search results =~ 500mb

[!] You must add a delay between each request, otherwise ip is going to be banned. If you are banned you have to get a new ip/server. 
	Banned IP seems irreversable.
    Currently delay is set to 5 seconds between each search and 3 seconds to browse through results pages ( page 1,2,3 .. last )
    
[!] You must encode title name (movie,tvshow), before search other wise you get a bad request.Use urlencode function.

[!] Issues & Problems:

	Folders to save html files should be named by imdb codes to ensure data integrity.

[!] Data is saved in downloaded files and in database. After testing is complete you can delete folders.


[*] Steps to collect and import torrents from 1337x

STEPS:	

	1. You need a movies list to start searching for results at 1337x. 
	   Search for imdb-movies-list php script on github or check movies_list table in tm database
	   Get the list and start searching with Search1337x class.
	   Folders are created for each movie and results pages are saved in them.
	   example: 
			moviename: Independence Day: Resurgence
			folder: Independence_Day_Resurgence
			html file: Independence_Day_Resurgence_1, Independence_Day_Resurgence_2 , etc for each results pages

	2. Iterate through results pages, and download or parse HTML files for each torrent. 
	   You shuld match at least imdb and or year of the movie.
	   
	   There are 2 options here:
	   
			1. Collect all required data ( hash, torrent name, seeders/leechers, imdb codes , screenshots, torrent files, magnet links , etc... )
			or
			2. Collect information about the above and download later in another script/server 

	3. Import torrents into tm db. 

Issues with Tvshows from 1337x:

	-Tvshow Daredevil has Marvel in front of it. Take that into consideration when doing a match of imdb
