NOTES:

2000 saved movies results =~ 500mb


[!] You must add a delay between each request on 1337x, otherwise ip is going to be banned. If you are banned you have to get a new ip/server. 
	Banned IP seems irreversable.
    Currently delay is set to 5 seconds between each search and 3 seconds to browse through results pages ( page 1,2,3 .. last )
    
[!] You must encode title name (movie,tvshow), before search other wise you get a bad request.Use urlencode php function.

[!] Issues & Problems:

	Folders to save html files should be named by imdb codes to ensure data integrity.There are movies like 1994, or so which have more than one results in database

[*] Steps to collect and import torrents from 1337x

STEPS (summary):

	1. Search 1337x and save results pages for each movie
	2. Parse search results and save them, or start downloading HTML files for ech torrent
	3. ...

STEPS:	

	1. You need a movies list to start searching for results at 1337x. 
	   Search for imdb-movies-list php script on github or check movies_list table in tm database
	   Get the list and start searching with Search1337x class.
	   Folders are created for each movie and results pages are saved in them.
	   example: 
			moviename: Independence Day: Resurgence
			folder: Independence_Day_Resurgence
			html file: Independence_Day_Resurgence_1, Independence_Day_Resurgence_2 , etc for each results pages

	2. Iterate through results pages, and download or parse HTML files for each torrent. 
	   You shuld match at least imdb and or year of the movie.
	   
	   There are 2 options here:
	   
			1. Collect all required data ( hash, torrent name, seeders/leechers, imdb codes , screenshots, torrent files, magnet links , etc... )
			or
			2. Collect information about the above and download later in another script/server 

	3. Import torrents into tm db. 

Thoughts:

Maybe seperate the first 2 steps to an independent solution available for public release

NOTES on Movies according to 1337x.
There are some movie names like "1964", "1959", "2006". You moght consider add a match with the year of the movie when retrieving Search Results Pages
